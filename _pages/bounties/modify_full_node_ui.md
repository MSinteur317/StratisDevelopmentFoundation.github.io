# Bounty Description

You can download the Full Node UI from the Stratis github, and build it from source code. Then, when combined with running the Stratis Full Node, you have a wallet with a nice clean interface. However, we want to be able to add features to our wallet, as seen in some of the other bounties. These new features need to have corresponding buttons in the Full Node UI.

This task is to extend the UI to demonstrate how to add form fields and buttons to the Full Node UI that connect the Stratis Full Node API endpoints.
