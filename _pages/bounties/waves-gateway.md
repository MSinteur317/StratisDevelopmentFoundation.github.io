# Bounty Description

WAVES is a blockchain platform that has many "tokens", and a decentralized exchange for the trading of these tokens.

A WAVES gateway is a system that converts coins from an external blockchain to tokens, so they can be traded on the decentralized exchange, and allows the tokens to be redeemed again back to coins again.

A framework for making gateways for coins can be found [here](https://github.com/jansenmarc/WavesGatewayFramework)

The task for this bounty is to make an open source Waves Gateway for the Stratis blockchain, so that Stratis coins can be moved on and off the Waves blockchain.
