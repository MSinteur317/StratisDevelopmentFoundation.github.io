# Development Articles

## Overview

Our goal is to help devs build useful things on the Stratis blockchain.

## Current Status

As you can see on this site, we have some articles that help a prospective Stratis developer get started building and learning. However many of them are incomplete. We need more people trying to use the articles and pointing out any issues, and we need more people creating and editing these articles. Anyone who helps will receive STRAT rewards.

## Next Tasks

1. Identify which tasks developers need information on.
2. Fund the creation of articles, with step by step instructions and screenshots
3. Get developers to run through the articles and make sure the articles are clear and correct.
