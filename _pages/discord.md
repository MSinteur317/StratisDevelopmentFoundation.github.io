## Discord Chat Server

Our discord is a chat room for people contributing to the SDF. Use it to find people to work with on projects, ask development related questions, and to discuss bounties.

## How to join the chat

After joining, you will be unable to talk in public rooms, and only able to talk in the #new_user room. In the #new_user room, please tell us a bit about your background (Developer? Writer? Web design? Student?) and what your interest is in the SDF (Bounties? Projects? Writing articles? Promoting Stratis?). After this introduction, an admin will give you access to communicate in the public chat rooms.
