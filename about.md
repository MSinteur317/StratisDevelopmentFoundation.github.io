The Stratis Development Foundation is a community project. Our goal is to make the Stratis blockchain and associated technologies widely used by developers. To support this goal, we will be doing 3 things:

Providing learning materials and sample code to make it easy for developers to get started using the Stratis blockchain
Fund bounties for creating software and other materials that support development on the Stratis blockchain
Create and maintain a protocol registry system to help guide development of community applications on the Stratis blockchain
