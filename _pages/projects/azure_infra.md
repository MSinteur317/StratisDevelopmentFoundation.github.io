short_overview: Creating Azure templates for servers that support common blockchain development tasks

# Azure Cloud Infrastructure

## Overview

There are various servers needed for blockchain development. One example is if you are creating a website that accepts Stratis as payment. You can't leave such a server running on your laptop at home. You need a cloud server that handles connections to the web front end, connections to a Stratis Full Node, and connections to a database of addresses and private keys. So to help reduce the complexity of creating a blockchain development solution, the SDF will create "server templates" that can be deployed quickly on Azure. Common servers needed will be identified and created.

## Next Tasks

1. Find people with Azure infrastructure expertise
2. Identify some of the most common servers needed for blockchain development
3. Fund the creation of Azure server templates

## Common servers in need of templates

* Stratis Full Node (probably already templatized by the Stratis team, need to investigate)
* Stratis Block Explorer
* Secure transaction signing wallet
* Backend for a web wallet
