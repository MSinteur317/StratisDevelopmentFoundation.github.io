# About the Stratis Development Foundation

The Stratis Development Foundation is a community project. Our goal is to make the Stratis blockchain and associated technologies widely used by developers. To support this goal, we will be doing 3 things:

* Providing learning materials and sample code to make it easy for developers to get started using the Stratis blockchain
* Fund bounties for creating software and other materials that support development on the Stratis blockchain
* Create and maintain a protocol registry system to help guide development of community applications on the Stratis blockchain
