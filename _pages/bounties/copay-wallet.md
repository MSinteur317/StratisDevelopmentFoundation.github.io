# Bounty Description

Copay is an open source cross platform wallet, with a lot of useful features. Porting it to Stratis would be very beneficial. This will give us a mature and extensively used in production cross platform mobile wallet.

A developer who has done a port of copay to a different blockchain had this to say about porting Copay to Stratis:

> "Once you port bitcore there’s not much changes required. It requires the tx structure to be updated to support our tx structure, as well as the block structure, and potentially some serialisation changes.
>
> Porting Copay is not a complex projects and does not require more than 20 lines of changes, it’s mostly changing network parameters and the things I mentioned above. Any proficient JS dev with the most basic understanding of the blockchain could do it."
