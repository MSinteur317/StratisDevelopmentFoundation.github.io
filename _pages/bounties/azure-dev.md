# Setting up a development environment on Azure

This article will show you how to create a VPC (Virtual Private Server) in the cloud that can run Visual Studio and a Stratis Node. This will allow you to have a development environment that is remote - separate from your local computer - that you can RDP to and develop on. This is beneficial for people who want to keep any Stratis code they are developing seperate from their local computer, for security reasons.

## Create an Azure account

## Create a windows Azure instance

## RDP to the windows instance

## Follow instructions on how to create a windows Stratis development environment
