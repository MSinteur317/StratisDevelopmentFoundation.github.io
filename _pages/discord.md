## Discord Chat Server

Our discord is a chat room for people contributing to the SDF.

This is not a social club. In order to keep the discussion focused on Stratis Development, off-topic chat will not be permitted.

People who contribute to the SDF in some way will be given access to private rooms to discuss the future of the SDF.

## How to join

Join at this link: [SDF Discord](https://discord.gg/99EX7d4){: .btn .btn--info}

After joining, you will be unable to talk in public rooms, and only able to talk in the #new_user room. In the #new_user room, please tell us a bit about your background (Developer? Writer? Web design? Student?) and what your interest is in the SDF (Bounties? Projects? Writing articles? Promoting Stratis?). After this introduction, an admin will give you access to communicate in the public chat rooms.
