# Port RPC calls to API

There are some operations that can be done via RPC calls. However the Stratis Full Node has an API that in many ways makes RPC calls obsolete.

There is a bounty of 10 strat for converting an RPC call to an API call, and a total pool of 100 strat to fund this (since there are many RPC calls to be converted).
