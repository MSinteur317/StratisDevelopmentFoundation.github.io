# Setting up a (QT) Stratis Node for RPC

This article will show you how to install the old Stratis wallet ("QT") and how to configure it to function as an API for other programs to access it.

## Download and run the Stratis QT wallet
1. [Download Stratis-QT wallet](https://github.com/stratisproject/stratisX/releases/tag/v2.0.0.3) (version on Windows or Mac)
2. Unzip downloaded file 
3. Run *stratis-qt.exe* in your directory (give permission for your Windows firewall if it is neceessary). Your qt-wallet should look like this:
    ![alt text](/assets/images/qt_wallet.png "qt_wallet")

## Modify the stratis.conf file to enable the RPC server
1. Make sure that your wallet is closed

2. FOR WINDOWS: 

    Search for the folder: %APPDATA% (path to directory stratis for windows: *C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Stratis*)

    FOR MAC:

    Search for the folder: *~/Library/Application Support/stratis/*
5. Open your notepad or other program to editing (I recommend [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.6.html))
4. Your set data to file according of pattern like this:
    ```
    # RPC Settings
    # Activate RPC Server (default: 0)
    server = 1
    # Where the RPC Server connects (default: 127.0.0.1 and ::1)
    rpcconnect = 127.0.0.1
    # Ip address allowed to connect to RPC (default all: 0.0.0.0 and ::)
    rpcallowedip = 127.0.0.1
    rpcuser = name_of_your_user
    rpcpassword = name_of_your_password
    ```
5. Save the file as stratis.conf (make sure you have file with .conf extension like on image below):
![alt text](/assets/images/conf_extension.png "conf_extension")

## Sync the blockchain
1. Run Stratis-QT wallet
2. First of all you should see synchronized blockchain network:

    ![alt text](/assets/images/qt_wallet_synchronizing_blockchain.png "qt_wallet_synchronizing_blockchain")

    Which means your wallet download blockchain blocks.
    Synchronizing of blockchain may go couple hours! You must be patient :)

## Test the RPC connection
1. When synchronization of Stratis-QT is finished you should see the following in blue square:

    ![alt text](/assets/images/qt_wallet_up_to_date_blockchain.png "qt_wallet_up_to_date_blockchain")

    Which means Stratis-QT wallet is no longer downloading blocks and is up to date at the current block.

    It looks like you finished this tutorial. You can use Stratis-QT wallet right now. Enjoy it!
